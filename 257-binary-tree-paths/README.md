# 257. Binary Tree Paths

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]

Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
