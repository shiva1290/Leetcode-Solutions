# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: true

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
	-104 <= Node.val <= 104

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
