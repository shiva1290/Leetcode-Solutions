# 137. Single Number II

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
	Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
