# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my accepted solutions to LeetCode problems.

## 🚀 Want to Create Your Own Repository Like This?

If you'd like to create a similar organized repository of your LeetCode solutions, I've built tools to make this process automatic:

### Step 1: Download Your Existing Solutions
Use my **[LeetCode Solution Downloader](https://github.com/shiva1290/Leetcode-Solution-Downloader)** to automatically download all your accepted LeetCode submissions:

- 🚀 **Downloads your actual accepted solutions** (not templates!)
- 📁 **GitHub repository format**: Each problem in `number-title` folders  
- 💾 **Real C++ code** from your accepted submissions
- 📝 **Comprehensive README files** with problem descriptions
- 🍪 **Browser cookie authentication** (no manual setup required)
- ⚡ **100% success rate** on solution downloads

```bash
# Quick setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
python leetcode_downloader.py
```

### Step 2: Keep It Updated Automatically
After setting up your repository with the downloader, you can use browser extensions like **[LeetSync](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetsync-leetcode-to-gith/ppkbejeolfcbaomanmbpjdbkfcjfhjnd?hl=en)** to automatically add new solutions as you solve them on LeetCode.

### Why This Approach?
- ✅ **One-time setup**: Download all existing solutions instantly
- ✅ **Automatic updates**: New solutions added automatically  
- ✅ **GitHub ready**: Perfect folder structure and documentation
- ✅ **Portfolio ready**: Professional presentation of your coding skills
