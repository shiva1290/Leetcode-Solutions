# 135. Candy

## Problem Statement

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

	Each child must have at least one candy.
	Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

Constraints:

	n == ratings.length
	1 <= n <= 2 * 104
	0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
