# 503. Next Greater Element II

## Problem Statement

Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn&#39;t exist, return -1 for this number.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1&#39;s next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can&#39;t find next greater number. 
The second 1&#39;s next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]

Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 104
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
