# 203. Remove Linked List Elements

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []

Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
	1 <= Node.val <= 50
	0 <= val <= 50

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
