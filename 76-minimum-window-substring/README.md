# 76. Minimum Window Substring

## Problem Statement

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, and &#39;C&#39; from string t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both &#39;a&#39;s from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one &#39;a&#39;, return empty string.

Constraints:

	m == s.length
	n == t.length
	1 <= m, n <= 105
	s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
