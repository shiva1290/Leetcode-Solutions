# 3110. Score of a String

## Problem Statement

You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Return the score of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"

Output: 13

Explanation:

The ASCII values of the characters in s are: &#39;h&#39; = 104, &#39;e&#39; = 101, &#39;l&#39; = 108, &#39;o&#39; = 111. So, the score of s would be |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111| = 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13.

Example 2:

Input: s = "zaz"

Output: 50

Explanation:

The ASCII values of the characters in s are: &#39;z&#39; = 122, &#39;a&#39; = 97. So, the score of s would be |122 - 97| + |97 - 122| = 25 + 25 = 50.

Constraints:

	2 <= s.length <= 100
	s consists only of lowercase English letters.
