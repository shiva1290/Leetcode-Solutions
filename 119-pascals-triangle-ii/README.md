# 119. Pascal's Triangle II

## Problem Statement

Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndexth (0-indexed) row of the Pascal&#39;s triangle.

In Pascal&#39;s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

Example 1:
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Example 2:
Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]
Example 3:
Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1,1]

Constraints:

	0 <= rowIndex <= 33

Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra space?

## Solution

The solution is implemented in C++ and can be found in the `solution.cpp` file.
